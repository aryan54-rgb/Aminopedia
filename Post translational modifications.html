            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) are chemical changes made to proteins after they are synthesized during translation. These modifications play a critical role in regulating protein function, localization, stability, and interactions.</p>

            <h2>1. Lysine</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><ins>Chemical Structure:</ins>Lysine is an α-amino acid with the chemical formula C₆H₁₄N₂O₂. It has an amino group (-NH₂)</li>
                <li><ins>Essential Amino Acid:</ins>It cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet, making it essential for growth and tissue repair</li>
                <li><ins>Hydrophilic:</ins>Due to its polar nature, lysine is water-soluble, which is important for its transport and function in the body</li>
                <li><ins>pKa Values:</ins>Lysine has multiple pKa values, which affect its ionization state and solubility depending on the pH of the environment</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Nutritional Supplement</li>
                <li>Viral Infection Management</li>

            <h2>2. Proline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><ins>Chemical Structure and Formula:</ins>: Proline is classified as a non-essential amino acid with the chemical formula C₅H₉N₁O₂. Its structure includes a five-membered ring formed by the amino group and the side chain, making it a cyclic amino acid</li>
                <li><ins>Non-Essential Amino Acid</ins>While proline can be synthesized by the body, it can also be obtained through diet, primarily from protein sources</li>
                <li><ins>Unique Conformation:</ins>The cyclic structure of proline introduces rigidity in polypeptides, influencing protein folding and stability</li>
                <li><ins>Hydrophobic Character:</ins>Proline is generally hydrophobic, although it can also exhibit polar characteristics due to its amine group, allowing it to play diverse roles in protein structures</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Collagen Production</li>
                <li>Proline is used in dietary supplements to support joint health</li>

            <h2>3. Serine</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><ins>Chemical Structure:</ins>Serine has the chemical formula C₃H₇N₁O₃. It contains a hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) in its side chain, which makes it polar and hydrophilic</li>
                <li><ins>Non-Essential Amino Acid:</ins>The body can synthesize serine from other compounds, meaning it does not need to be obtained solely through diet</li>
                <li><ins>Hydrophilic Nature:</ins>Due to its polar characteristics, serine is soluble in water and plays an important role in protein interactions and enzymatic reactions.</li>
                <li><ins>Role in Protein Structure:</ins>Serine can participate in hydrogen bonding, which contributes to protein stability and folding</li>
                <li><ins>Phosphorylation:</ins>It can undergo post-translational modification through phosphorylation, affecting protein function and signaling pathways</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoting cognitive function</li>
                <li>Contributes to the synthesis of D-serine, a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor</li>
