            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hormonal derivatives are substances that are chemically derived from natural hormones. They are often designed to retain or modify the biological activity of the parent hormone for specific medical or research purposes. Hormonal derivatives can be synthetic or naturally occurring and are used in various applications such as hormone replacement therapy, contraception, cancer treatment, or as tools in scientific studies.</p>
