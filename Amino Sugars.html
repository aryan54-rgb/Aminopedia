            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Amino sugars are a type of sugar molecule in which a hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by an amino group (-NH₂). These sugars are derivatives of monosaccharides and play a significant role in biological processes, particularly in the structure and function of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans.</p>

            3. <u><b>Mannosamine</b></u> - N-acetylmannosamine
               Mannosamine and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) are closely related compounds involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids, 
               which play essential roles in a variety of biological functions.
        
               <b>a) <u>Mannosamine chemical properties</u> :</b>
               
               1. Chemical Structure: Mannosamine is an amino sugar derived from mannose, where the hydroxyl group at the 2-position is 
                replaced by an amino group (-NH₂), making it an aminosugar.
               
               2. Biosynthesis Role: Mannosamine is a precursor to N-acetylmannosamine. It can be converted into N-acetylmannosamine by 
                the action of N-acetyltransferase, which adds an acetyl group (-COCH₃) to the amino group.
        
               3. Metabolic Pathway: Mannosamine is involved in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway and can be converted into 
                N-acetylmannosamine, which is a crucial step in the production of sialic acids.
            
        
                <b>b) <u>N-acetyl-Mannosamine chemical properties</u> :</b>
               
                1. Chemical Structure: N-acetylmannosamine is an acetylated derivative of mannosamine, where the amino group (-NH₂) of 
                 mannosamine is acetylated to form N-acetyl (COCH₃).
         
                2. Key Function: N-acetylmannosamine is a key precursor in the biosynthesis of sialic acids (such as N-acetylneuraminate). 
                 These sialic acids are important components of glycoproteins and glycolipids and play critical roles in cell-cell 
                 interactions, immune response regulation, and cellular protection from pathogens.
         
                3. Biosynthesis of Sialic Acids: N-acetylmannosamine is converted into CMP-sialic acid (cytidine monophosphate sialic acid), 
                 which is the activated form of sialic acid. This form of sialic acid is then incorporated into glycoproteins and glycolipids, 
                 a process crucial for proper cell surface functioning.

            4. <u><b>Fucose</b></u> - L-fucose
               Fucose (or L-fucose) is a naturally occurring monosaccharide, which is a type of sugar. It is an important component of glycans 
               (sugar chains) in glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing various biological processes.
        
               <b>a) <u>Fucose- L-fucose chemical properties</u> :</b>
                
               1. Reducing Sugar: L-fucose has an aldehyde group in its open-chain form, making it a reducing sugar that can reduce agents 
                 like Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions.
         
               2. Cyclic Forms: It primarily exists as a pyranose (six-membered ring) but can also form a furanose (five-membered ring) 
                 structure.
         
               3. Acid Reactivity: L-fucose can undergo acid hydrolysis and participate in glycosylation, forming glycosidic bonds with 
                 alcohols or other sugars.
        
               4. Oxidation: It can be oxidized to fucic acid, and reduced to fucitol (a sugar alcohol).
               
               5. Glycosylation: L-fucose is involved in fucosylation, where it is added to glycoproteins and glycolipids via 
                 fucosyltransferases.
               
               6. Solubility: L-fucose is water-soluble due to its hydroxyl groups.
