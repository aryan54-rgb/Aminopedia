    1.  <u><b>Glycylalanine </b></u>(Gly-Ala)
       Glycylalanine is a dipeptide formed by the condensation of the amino acids glycine and alanine. Its chemical structure
       can be represented as Gly-Ala, where glycine is the amino acid with the simplest structure (a single hydrogen atom as 
       its side chain), and alanine is a standard amino acid with a methyl group (-CH₃) as its side chain.

        <b>> <u>Glycylalanine chemical properties</u> :</b>
       
       1. Peptide Bond: Formed between the amino group of glycine and the carboxyl group of alanine.
       
       2. Acid-Base Properties: It has both acidic (carboxyl groups) and basic (amino groups) functionalities. It can 
        ionize depending on pH, with a pI around 6.2–6.5.
       
       3. Solubility: Soluble in water, with solubility affected by pH (ionic charge).
       
       4. Hydrolysis: Can be broken down into glycine and alanine by hydrolysis, catalyzed by acids, bases, or enzymes.
       
       5. Optical Activity: The peptide is optically active due to the chirality of glycine and alanine.
       
       6. Reactivity: Can undergo esterification (reaction with alcohols) and nucleophilic attack (peptide bond cleavage).
       
       7. Stability: Stable under neutral conditions but can degrade under extreme pH or high temperature.

    2.  <u><b>Lysylserine</b></u> (Lys-Ser)
       Lysylserine is a dipeptide consisting of two amino acids: lysine and serine. It is a relatively simple peptide where
       lysine (a basic amino acid) is linked to serine (a polar,neutral amino acid) via a peptide bond.

        <b>> <u>Lysylserine chemical properties</u> :</b>
       
       1. Ionization: Lysylserine, like other peptides, can ionize at different pH levels due to the amino and carboxyl 
        groups.The lysine residue (with its amino group) tends to be protonated and positively charged at physiological pH, 
        while the serine carboxyl group can be deprotonated.
       
       2. Solubility: Lysylserine is soluble in water, primarily due to the hydrophilic nature of both lysine and serine's 
        side chains, which can interact with water molecules.
       
       3. Acid-Base Properties: Lysylserine has both acidic and basic properties (due to the amino and carboxyl groups), and 
        it can act as a buffer in biochemical reactions.

    3.  <u><b>Glycylglycine</b></u> (Gly-Gly)
       Glycylglycine is a dipeptide composed of two glycine molecules linked by a peptide bond. It is one of the simplest 
       peptides, consisting of two identical amino acids, glycine, which is the smallest amino acid with a single hydrogen 
       atom as its side chain.  

        <b>> <u>Glycylglycine chemical properties</u> :</b>
       
       1. Peptide Bond: Like all peptides, glycylglycine contains apeptide bond (–CO–NH–), which is the linkage between the 
        amino group of one glycine molecule and the carboxyl group of the other.
       
       2. Solubility: Glycylglycine is highly soluble in water because both glycine residues are hydrophilic, with their amino 
        and carboxyl groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules.
       
       3. Acid-Base Properties: Glycylglycine, like most peptides, has both acidic and basic properties. The carboxyl groups 
        (–COOH) can lose a proton (deprotonate) in basic conditions, while the amino groups (–NH₂) can gain a proton (protonate)
        in acidic conditions. This means glycylglycine can act as a buffer in different pH ranges.

    4.  <u><b>Glutamylcysteine</b></u> (Glu-Cys)
        Glutamylcysteine is a dipeptide composed of the amino acids L-glutamate and L-cysteine. It plays a crucial role as an 
        intermediate in the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant in cellular defense mechanisms. 

        <b>> <u>Glutamylcysteine chemical properties</u> :</b>
        
        1. Structural Composition:
        
          > Glutamate Component: Contains a gamma-carboxylic acid group and an amino group.
          > Cysteine Component: Contains a sulfhydryl (-SH) group, which contributes to its reactivity.
        
        2. pKa Values:

          > The carboxylic acid groups (on glutamate and cysteine) and the amino group make glutamylcysteine a zwitterion at 
          physiological pH (7.4).
          > pKa (Cysteine thiol group): ~8.3
          > pKa (Glutamate gamma-carboxyl group): ~4.3
          > pKa (C-terminal carboxylic acid group): ~2.1
        
        3. Solubility:

          > Soluble in water due to the presence of polar functional groups.
          > Poor solubility in organic solvents like ethanol or acetone.
        
        4. Polarity: Highly polar due to its amino, carboxyl, and thiol groups.
        
        5. Reactivity:

          > The thiol (-SH) group on cysteine is reactive and plays a significant role in redox reactions and disulfide bond 
          formation.
          > Susceptible to oxidation, where the thiol group can form a disulfide bond with another molecule of glutamylcysteine
          or glutathione.
